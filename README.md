# esp32_lorawan_oled_ttn-otaa
An working example to send data through LoRaWAN-TTN network using an WIFI LoRa 32 (V2) from Heltec Automation using Terry Moores Arduino port from Thomas Telkamp and Matthijs Kooijman. oktavianabd/arduino-lmic https://github.com/oktavianabd/arduino-lmic

   "To use this sketch, first register your application and device with
   the things network, to set or generate an AppEUI, DevEUI and AppKey.
   Multiple devices can use the same AppEUI, but each device has its own
   DevEUI and AppKey.

   Do not forget to define the radio type correctly in
   arduino-lmic/project_config/lmic_project_config.h or from your BOARDS.txt."
